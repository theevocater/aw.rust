aw.rust
=======

I've been meaning to learn rust and so why not write my first interpreter in it based off of [Lindsey Kuper's simple one](https://github.com/lkuper/aw).

=== TODO ===

* I would like to set up rust's packaging/building/stuff for learnings sake.

* I need to figure out how to do better "erroring out" rather than just crashing.

* There isn't a parser yet, so you have to write out the crazy grammar.
